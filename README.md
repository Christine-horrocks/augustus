## Requirements
[Augustus][augustus] requires the following:
* [NodeJS][node] - [click here][node-version] for the exact version
* [NPM][npm]

## Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ukparliament/augustus.git
cd augustus
npm install
npm cache clean --force && npm test
```

## Running the application
To run the application locally, open 2 terminal shells. In one run:

```bash
npm cache clean --force && node app.js
```
To run the app.

In the other shell run:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/shunter-serve
```
To run the shunter serve.

The application should now be available at [http://localhost:5400][local].

## Using components
[Augustus][augustus] uses [Pugin][pugin] as its components library which uses the [Dust][dust] templating language. However, you can use your own [Dust][dust] components by placing them in the `view` directory in the project's root. You can refer to the [Shunter templating documentation][shunter-templating-docs] for more information on how to do this.

## Starting Augustus and Shunter serve in a Docker Image   
If you wish to run Augustus with shunter serve in a docker image in a development environment, use the following commands:  

To build the Docker image  

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

To run Augustus and Shunter serve  
```bash
docker-compose up
```
The application will then be available from http://localhost/.

## i18n Note
Please note, that while normally data would be passed into a string in a translation file using double moustaches which sanitises input, when passing in a URL or other form of content which you do not wish to be sanitised you must use triple moustaches or it will not be rendered correctly in the output. For example:

```
"cookie-policy": "<a href='{{{link}}}'>Cookie Policy</a>"
```  

Will be rendered correctly as:  

```
<a href='/meta/cookie'>Cookie Policy</a>
```
